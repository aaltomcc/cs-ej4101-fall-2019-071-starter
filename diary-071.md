## _My expectation from this course !!!_
- DevOps is quite popular buzzword which is used quite often with cloud technology and big data analytics. With my company is moving into delivering analytic based service solutions , which are developed in cloud environment , it seems a must to learn what is devOps to start with. Specially  using waterfall methods for services devdelopment for many years where there is clear requirment defintions and quality check before deployment , it has been question on how to gurantee quality with agile development methods. So I thought this course would give me knowledge of what DevOPs actually mean & how it is implemented. 


## _Things I learned or hopefully learn by end of the day  !!_
- Though the expectation is to learn devOPs , I think I learn other useful stuf during course. I think I did not get good practical knowledge on DevOps methos like continous integrsation , continous deployment since I did not have time to do advanced project. But I learn lot of small stuff like
  - if DevOps is for me or not
  - How automating tasks can help in solving the problems
  - Difference between traditional versus DevOps software Development Life Cycle
- But more importantly I learned,
  - Git version control system
  - markdown language
  - Web sit development using github pages
  - static web site generators like jekyll, Hugo
  - hopefull will learn how Continous Integration can be done using Travis CI
